			<p>The Internet of Things has a lot to offer in almost every domain we can think of starting with data. IoT generates a large amount of data. The more the information analyzed, the easier it gets to make the right decisions. With cognitive data insights, we are able to predict consumer patterns, which strongly impact current and future marketing strategies and customer experience. And since IoT seeks to heighten accuracy, it is set to eliminate errors while monitoring and tracking things in real-time. This high-level of precision will facilitate the automation process of routine and repetitive tasks which would otherwise be very time-consuming. And as time is money, you will also feel it in your pocket.<br>The Internet of Things is also set to create more financial opportunities by reducing costs and processes complexity. According to McKinsey, linking the physical and digital worlds could generate up to $11.1 trillion a year in economic value by 2025.<br>You are already experiencing some of its benefits with products like Google Home, Amazon Echo, Fitbit and others</p>

			<h2>A disadvantage of the Internet of Things (IoT)<h2>

			<p>With the advancement in technology and social media, user’s data is always available on the internet and with the things being connected with the internet, hackers are provided with yet another tool to be able to break into the network and steal the information. One might want some space in life that is personal, so it’s not easy to always stay connected with family and friends and give them every aspect of our life operation. There is every possibility that your data can be misused.<br> Several precautions and protocols have been implemented by cybersecurity organizations to prevent unauthorized access and misuse of personal data. However, there is always a loophole in the technology that can be exploited by hackers. For instance, a hacker group named anonymous broke into government databases and leaked classified information to the public. The highest level of security precaution considered by the government failed to protect the data and the security framework was infringed. Therefore, if all our information is stored on the internet, hackers can easily break into it, finding out all about people’s lives. The information they are given access to could also be misused by companies to exploit the users.  This is a growing mishap happening all the time inside companies.  For example, Google recently was accused of using private information provided by users for the company’s benefit.</p>		</article>
