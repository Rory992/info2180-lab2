			<p>The Internet of Things has a lot to offer in almost every domain we can think of starting with data. IoT generates a large amount of data. The more the information analyzed, the easier it gets to make the right decisions. With cognitive data insights, we are able to predict consumer patterns, which strongly impact current and future marketing strategies and customer experience. And since IoT seeks to heighten accuracy, it is set to eliminate errors while monitoring and tracking things in real-time. This high-level of precision will facilitate the automation process of routine and repetitive tasks which would otherwise be very time-consuming. And as time is money, you will also feel it in your pocket.<br>The Internet of Things is also set to create more financial opportunities by reducing costs and processes complexity. According to McKinsey, linking the physical and digital worlds could generate up to $11.1 trillion a year in economic value by 2025.<br>You are already experiencing some of its benefits with products like Google Home, Amazon Echo, Fitbit and others</p>
